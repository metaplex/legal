<h1>Metaplex Bug Bounty Program Terms and Conditions</h1>
<p>Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at Metaplex Foundation, a Cayman Islands not-for-profit company (“Company” or “Metaplex”). Metaplex has established a bounty program to compensate researchers who share with the Company critical issues about Metaplex’s products and services and the techniques used to exploit them, with the goal of resolving confirmed issues as quickly as possible. Metaplex offers public recognition and a bounty payment (“Bug Bounty”) for those who submit valid reports and related software code identifying a security issue or vulnerability with Metaplex’s platform or software (a “Bug”). By clicking “Accept” or submitting any Bug report or code to the Company, you agree to these Metaplex Bug Bounty Program Terms and Conditions (these “Terms and Conditions”). If you are not in agreement with these Terms and Conditions you may not submit Bug reports or software code to the Company.</p>

<p><strong>THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. THEY AFFECT YOUR AND THE COMPANY’S RIGHTS CONCERNING THE RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND METAPLEX.</strong></p>

<p>Metaplex reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms and Conditions at any time, provided that any changes, modifications, additions, or removals will only be applicable to Bug reports or software code submitted after the date of such changes, modifications, additions, or removals. It is your responsibility to check these Terms and Conditions periodically for changes. Your submission of Bug reports or software code following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the changes.</p>
